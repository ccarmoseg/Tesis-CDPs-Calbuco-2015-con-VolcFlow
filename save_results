% Script to save VolcFlow results as .mat and .tiff files

% Get the current directory
current_dir = pwd;

% Save 'h' as a .mat file
save(fullfile(current_dir, 'volcflow_results.mat'), 'h');
disp('Results saved as volcflow_results.mat');

% Convert 'h' to a georeferenced tiff
% First, we need to ensure we have the correct geospatial information
% This assumes you have this information from your original DEM
% If not, you'll need to modify this part accordingly

% Load the original DEM to get spatial reference info
load('Copernicus_30m_Calbuco_2015.mat', 'z');

% Check if the sizes match
if ~isequal(size(h), size(z))
    error('The sizes of h and the original DEM do not match. Cannot create georeferenced tiff.');
end

% Create a spatial referencing object
% This assumes your DEM is in UTM coordinates. Modify as needed.
R = maprefcells([min(y) max(y)], [min(x) max(x)], size(z));

% Write the georeferenced tiff
geotiffwrite(fullfile(current_dir, 'volcflow_results.tif'), h, R);
disp('Results saved as volcflow_results.tif');

% Display confirmation message
disp('Results have been saved successfully in both .mat and .tif formats.');
